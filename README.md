# DeepCOLA

This code is a Python implementation of DeepCOLA (Deep COmpetitive Learning Algorithm). The DeepCOLA takes appliance-level electricity consumption data as input and produces the clusters.

# How to run the code

The DeepCOLA algorithm requires following libraries in order to run and produce clusters.

* Python 3
* Numpy
* SciPy
* Matplotlib
* Tensorflow
* Keras

The DeepCOLA algorithm utlizes TensorFlow as backend. The easiast way to install above libraries is by using Anaconda from the [Link](https://www.anaconda.com/). The Anaconda tool provides built-in support for Python 3, Numpy, SciPy and Matplotlib. However, Keras can be installed using the Conda comannds. 

```
conda install -c conda-forge keras 
```

# Dataset

The [UK-Dale](https://www.anaconda.com/) electricity consumption dataset at the appliace-level is used for the experiments.
