# DeepCOLA

This code is a Python implementation of DeepCOLA (Deep COmpetitive Learning Algorithm). The DeepCOLA takes appliance-level electricity consumption data as input and produces the clusters.

# How to run the code
The DeepCOLA algorithm requires following libraries in order to run and produce clusters.

* Python 3
* Numpy
* Matplotlib
* Tensorflow
* Keras

The easiast way to install above libraries is by using Anaconda from the following link.
